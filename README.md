## Kylrs-Quick-Dictionary
>Quick Awake Dictionary For Windows via Python

Hey folks, it's Kylr here. I recently realized that translating a single word by the translation websites or apps is so inconvenient. So I tried to code a program that is aiming to simplify this procedure.  

The essential pipeline of this project is explained down below:  
1. The main function(translation) is based on provided API, I used CNKI translation for test. You can feel free to change the API for your convenience. 
2. The GUI is based on PyQt5 make sure that your terminal could use this package properly
3. The implementation of the frosted glass effect is quoted from the CSDN forum and the author is ***之一Yo*** <https://blog.csdn.net/zhiyiYo/article/details/106739263>. Make sure that you already had his/her permission if you wanna use this effect for commercial use.
